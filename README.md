SPERM - Surprisingly Practical Extendable Rest Module

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SperoSophia/Sperm/master/web/sperm.png" align="right" />

After years of playing with ASP.NET both classical, MVC & WebAPI even touched Nancy at a point.
I wanted something different. Something that fit in to our current ways of writing extendable web applications.

Clients would out-source plugin work, and write a ton of stuff them self.
Ad-hoc requests from everyone about small features here and there.

This is a collection of tools that was assembled in to a framework that will serve us better in the future.

Pull requests are of course more than welcome.

ps. The name "CAME" from a funny notion that developers and business people often sit in the same room
when the developers are talking in-between themselfs I thought it would be funny to
have the business people overhear, Sperm, JizzException, Cunt Management.
Powerful and dirty.

As well, lets not forget that these components are to be used cross projects.
So often we start a new MVC project and start a new Account section. It is suppose to be CSS
only for new projects when we speak of account controllers.

So for the LOVE of all, inject sperm into everything.
