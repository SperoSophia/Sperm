Something that fit in to our current ways of writing extendable web applications.\r\n\r\nClients would out-source plugin work, and write a ton of stuff them self.\r\nAd-hoc requests from everyone about small features here and there.\r\n\r\nThis is a collection of tools that was assembled in to a framework that will serve us better in the future.\r\n\r\nPull requests are of course more than welcome.\r\n\r\nps. The name \"CAME\" from a funny notion that developers and business people often sit in the same room\r\nwhen the developers are talking in-between themselfs I thought it would be funny to\r\nhave the business people overhear, Sperm, JizzException, Cunt Management.\r\nPowerful and dirty.\r\n\r\nAs well, lets not forget that these components are to be used cross projects.\r\nSo often we start a new MVC project and start a new Account section. It is suppose to be CSS\r\nonly for new projects when we speak of account controllers.\r\n\r\nSo for the LOVE of all, inject sperm into everything.\r\n",
