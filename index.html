<p>SPERM - Surprisingly Practical Extendable Rest Module</p>

<p><img align="right" src="https://github.com/SperoSophia/Sperm/blob/master/web/sperm.png"></p>

<p>After years of playing with ASP.NET both classical, MVC &amp; WebAPI even touched Nancy at a point.
I wanted something different. Something that fit in to our current ways of writing extendable web applications.</p>

<p>Clients would out-source plugin work, and write a ton of stuff them self.
Ad-hoc requests from everyone about small features here and there.</p>

<p>This is a collection of tools that was assembled in to a framework that will serve us better in the future.</p>

<p>Pull requests are of course more than welcome.</p>

<p>ps. The name "CAME" from a funny notion that developers and business people often sit in the same room
when the developers are talking in-between themselfs I thought it would be funny to
have the business people overhear, Sperm, JizzException, Cunt Management.
Powerful and dirty.</p>

<p>As well, lets not forget that these components are to be used cross projects.
So often we start a new MVC project and start a new Account section. It is suppose to be CSS
only for new projects when we speak of account controllers.</p>

<p>So for the LOVE of all, inject sperm into everything.</p>
